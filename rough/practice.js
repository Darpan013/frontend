line 13. we have assumed that value of b is equal to 1
line 14. then the thing we have wrriten in code is b += 10 which means b = b + 10 (11)
line 16. then we are doing b -= 5 which means b = previous b - 5, b = 11 -5 (6)
line 18. then we are doing b *= 10 which means b = previous b * 10, b = 6 * 10 (60)
line 20. then we are doing b /= 5  which means b = previous b / 10, b = 60 / 10 (12)
line 21. then we would get the output of be is 12     */
